# ðŸ“ˆ Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

---

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This project implements a deep learning model using **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks to predict future stock prices based on historical closing price data.

It includes:
- âœ… Real-time financial data via `yfinance`
- ðŸ§  A multi-layered LSTM architecture
- ðŸ”® Next **7-day price forecasting**
- ðŸ“Š Rich visualizations including actual vs predicted, error plots, and interactive Plotly graphs
